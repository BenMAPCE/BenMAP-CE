The environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Programâ€”Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) is used to conduct air pollution benefits assessment, which is the art and science of applying findings from the epidemiological and economics literature to estimate the health impacts and economic value of air pollution changes. The BenMAP-CE software simplifies this practice by applying the algorithms and data that users need to calculate the quantity, and dollar value, of premature deaths and illnesses associated with changes in air pollution.

The BenMAP-CE Database file (while under development) will be maintained separately from this main BenMAP-CE code repository due to large file size.  To acquire the most recently released version of the database, please install BenMAP-CE using the install package available at [BenMAP-CE Community Edition](https://www.epa.gov/benmap/benmap-community-edition).
